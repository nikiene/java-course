# TODO List

in this project I'm following along the Rocketseat's mini Java Course and building a TODO List, and making my own changes to it.

#

# What I'm Using on this project:
 * H2 Database Engine
 * Spring Boot Framework
 * Hibernate ORM
 * Docker

#

You can pull this Docker image using the command below:
```
docker pull ghcr.io/nikiene/java-spring-hibernate-todo-list:latest
```

#

Usage:

#

[TODO] - Show working endpoints + functionalities.

#

Once I'm finished with this i will make a React Front-End integration for it.
